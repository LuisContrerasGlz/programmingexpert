"""

Write a program that implements a simple interactive dictionary. Start by prompting the user with the following:

Enter a word in English or EXIT: << put a space at the end of this message

When the user enters EXIT in capital letters, terminate the program with the following:

Bye!

Otherwise, try to find the German equivalent in the dictionary provided in the exercise.

a. if the word is in the dictionary, print: Translation: {} << replace {} with the word from the dictionary
b. if the word is not in the dictionary, print: No match!

You should keep asking the user for new words with the same prompt ('Enter a word in English or EXIT: ') until the user provides EXIT.
