    Write a function that accepts a list of strings that represent words and a
    positive integer n , representing the number of words to return.
    Your function should return a new list containing the n longest unique words from the input list. 
    Words are unique if they only appear one time in the input list.

    There will always be exactly n words to return and you may
    return the words in any order.

    Note: all strings in the input list will not contain any special characters
    or spaces.
