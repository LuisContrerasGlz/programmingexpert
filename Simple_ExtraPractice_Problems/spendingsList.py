John has a hard time keeping his budget. Write a program to help him analyse his spendings. You are given a list with John's spendings for each month. Go through the list, and count the number of times...

a. the spendings were low (< 1000.0)
b. the spendings were normal (between 1000.0 and 2500.0 inclusive)
c. the spendings were high (> 2500.0)

Then, print the following to the output:

Numbers of months with low spendings: {}, normal spendings: {}, high spendings: {}.
